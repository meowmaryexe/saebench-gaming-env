"""2-layer FFN projection vs single-linear projection — hypothesis check.

The agent is dropped into the researcher's working dir mid-writeup: the
team's ablation showed a 2-layer FFN projection beating a single-linear
projection on the 17M model (NDCG@10 0.6405 vs 0.6286). The researcher's
intuition is that the extra layer gives more expressivity. The agent's
job is to verify the result is real, test the expressivity hypothesis,
and write up the actual mechanism.

The hidden ground truth (not in the workspace, used by the grader):

  Both Dense modules in the released 17M model use identity activation
  (see `model_files/1_Dense/config.json` and `model_files/2_Dense/
  config.json`: `"activation_function": "torch.nn.modules.linear.Identity"`).
  With identity activations, the 2-layer FFN is mathematically a single
  linear map: out = W2 @ W1 @ x. The composed matrix W_eff = W2 @ W1
  has the same shape (256 -> 48) and the same maximum rank (48) as any
  single linear projection of the same shape.

  `experiments/projection_decomposition/svd_per_layer.json` confirms this:
    - W1 (512 x 256): rank 256, eff rank 223, rank-95 = 200
    - W2 (48 x 512):  rank 48,  eff rank 47.3, rank-95 = 45
    - W_eff (48 x 256): rank 48, eff rank 46.8, rank-95 = 45
  W_eff is rank-48 (full possible rank given the 48 output dim). A single
  linear layer of the same shape would also be at most rank 48. SAME
  EXPRESSIVITY.

  `experiments/projection_decomposition/equivalence_check.json` confirms
  empirically: max abs diff between the 2-layer pipeline output and the
  collapsed W_eff pipeline output is ~1e-5 (float32 numerical noise);
  per-token cosine similarity is 1.0 to 6+ decimal places.

  So the +1 NDCG gap is NOT from expressivity. The actual mechanism is
  optimization dynamics. Overparameterized linear networks (W = W2 W1
  with both trained jointly) have implicit pre-conditioning on the
  gradient updates: each weight matrix sees a gradient that depends on
  the other, which can effectively act as an adaptive per-axis learning
  rate. Saxe et al. 2013 ('Exact solutions to the nonlinear dynamics of
  learning in deep linear neural networks') derived this; Arora et al.
  2018 ('On the Optimization of Deep Networks: Implicit Acceleration by
  Overparameterization') extended it. For a deep-LINEAR network with no
  nonlinearity, the model class is identical to a shallow linear one,
  but the LOSS LANDSCAPE is different — the deep version has saddle
  points that the shallow one doesn't, and gradient flow on the deep
  one can converge faster on certain axes.

  Practical implication for the team: the 2-layer projection is worth
  shipping (the +1 NDCG is real and reproducible across seeds per the
  team's own note in `experiments/projection_layer_ablation/
  results.json`). But framing it as 'more expressive' would be wrong;
  the correct framing is 'overparameterized linear map has better
  optimization dynamics'. A 3-layer extension might help further (same
  argument); adding a nonlinearity (e.g. GELU between the two layers)
  would create a genuinely-more-expressive function, which is a separate
  design axis.
