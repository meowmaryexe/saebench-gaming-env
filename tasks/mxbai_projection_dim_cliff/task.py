"""Projection-dim deployment recommendation. The agent is dropped into the
researcher's working dir mid-decision: pylate package at the root, the
team's encode/truncate/svd scripts under scripts/, last-sprint's trained-
dim ablation under experiments/trained_dim_ablation/, this-sprint's
post-hoc truncation under experiments/truncation_post_hoc/, the released
17M model under model_files/. Researcher's question, delivered in the
prompt, is "can we ship a smaller-projection variant of the 17M model
without retraining, and what's the right dim/strategy?"

The hidden ground truth (not in the workspace, used by the grader):

  - The TRAINED-dim cliff in the last-sprint ablation lands between dim
    48 (0.5967) and dim 32 (0.5772) — a -3.3% absolute drop. The team
    has been treating this as the lower bound for ship-quality.

  - POST-HOC truncation on the shipped 48-dim model behaves DIFFERENTLY:
    PCA-32 retains 0.6753 vs full-dim 0.6922 (-1.7% absolute on scifact,
    half the trained-cliff drop). Naive-32 retains 0.6645 (-2.8%).
    Random-32 retains 0.6591. PCA wins at every dim < 48.

  - The actual POST-HOC cliff in our data lives between dim 16 and dim 8:
    PCA goes 0.591 -> 0.302 (-49% relative), naive 0.553 -> 0.282 (-49%),
    random 0.536 -> 0.181 (-66%). Every other adjacent step is single-
    digit % degradation.

  - The reason for the trained-vs-post-hoc divergence: the SVD of the
    projection matrix W_eff = W2 @ W1 (48 x 256) is nearly full-rank
    (rank-for-95%-energy = 45, eff rank 46.8), but the PCA of the
    per-token embedding distribution is heavily concentrated (top-1 axis
    holds 66.7% of variance, top-16 holds 83.1%). The model packs signal
    into a low-rank-effective subspace of its 48-dim output even though
    the projection matrix itself uses all 48 dims evenly. PCA truncation
    keeps that subspace; naive truncation throws away whichever dims
    happened to hold variance.

  - Storage at dim K with avg ~208 tokens per doc and fp16: 20017 bytes
    at K=48, 10008 at K=24. The customer's <10kB/doc constraint forces
    dim <= 24.

  - The correct call: PCA-truncate to 24 (within 10kB/doc, retains 0.6488
    vs 0.6922 = -4.34 NDCG points, within the <5-point budget). PCA-32
    is better but violates storage budget. Avoid naive truncation when
    PCA is essentially free at deploy time (one 48x48 matmul per token).
