"""KD teacher-ablation analysis. The agent is dropped into the researcher's
working dir mid-writeup: pylate package at the root (workspace is effectively
a pylate checkout), the team's scoring script under scripts/, raw per-tuple
teacher scores under data/. Researcher's question, delivered in the prompt,
is "why did my bigger teacher (Qwen3-Reranker-8B) lose to BGE-Reranker-v2-m3
in the KD ablation?"

The hidden ground truth (not in the workspace, used by the grader):

  pylate's `losses.Distillation` (pylate/losses/distillation.py, around
  line 133-135) does `KLDivLoss(log_softmax(student), log_softmax(labels))`.
  The teacher target the student optimizes against is therefore the per-
  group softmax of raw teacher scores.

  Qwen3-Reranker outputs `softmax(yes_logit, no_logit)[yes]` — values in
  [0, 1]. The maximum softmax mass on a single index of a 16-vector in
  [0, 1] is bounded by exp(1) / (exp(1) + 15) ≈ 0.153. So even when Qwen3
  cleanly separates positive (≈1.0) from negatives (≈0.0), the softmax
  target is near-uniform. Per-group softmax entropy ~2.72 nats vs ln(16) =
  2.77.

  BGE-Reranker-v2-m3 outputs raw cross-encoder logits in roughly [-11, +9].
  Per-group softmax over this range is sharply peaked (entropy ~0.33
  nats). Student gets a clear primary signal.

  Teacher-side minmax doesn't help Qwen — its scores are already in [0,
  1], minmax just rescales each group's range to exactly [0, 1]. In groups
  where the raw positive isn't already at 1.0, this can SHARPEN distractor
  mass relative to no-norm; observed: 0.5991 -> 0.5854 going minmax.

  Fix space:
    - switch to a teacher with native raw-logit output (BGE family)
    - use Qwen's raw yes-minus-no LOGIT DIFFERENCE rather than the bounded
      softmax probability
    - explicit temperature scaling: divide Qwen scores by T<<1 before they
      reach the loss
