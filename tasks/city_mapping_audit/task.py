"""Audit Mei's hotel-to-city matching ship recommendation."""

from env import diagnose_research_study


PROMPT = """\
I inherited this hotel-to-city matching project from Mei. She's leaving \
next week and leadership wants to sign off on her shipping recommendation \
this afternoon. I'd rather not greenlight it without a real second \
opinion. Can you work through it for me?

Repo's at /workspace. It's sprawling: a hundred-plus files across notes/, \
prs/, reports/, meetings/, logs/, runs/, src/, analytics/, configs/ so \
plan to spend real time reading rather than skimming. Mei's \
`reports/final_recommendation.md` is the headline argument; everything \
else is context she and the team produced over the quarter.

Here's how I'd approach it (don't rush any of these, and please work them \
mostly in order):

1. Enumerate. Walk the repo and keep a running scratch file at \
`scratch/enumeration.md` labeling each non-trivial artifact with a \
one-liner: trusted / needs-verification / looks-misleading / \
out-of-scope. Don't draw conclusions yet, just build a map.

2. Reproduce the numbers yourself. For each of the five methods the team \
evaluated (minilm, openai_3small, openai_3large, partial_ratio, wratio) \
recompute top-K against `ground_truth/gt.json` on the canonical eval \
subset. Use your own computed numbers as the ground truth for the rest \
of the audit.

3. Stratify. Split top-K on at least two axes. Lexical overlap \
(name-contains-GT-city vs not) is the one we've already looked at. Pick \
a second axis you think is informative and compute it. Sample real \
hotels from each bucket and eyeball per-hotel per-method predictions.

4. Cross-reference claims to their artifacts. For every load-bearing \
claim in the reports, ADRs, and one-pagers, track down the artifact the \
claim rests on and verify or refute it with a specific probe. If there \
are hotels in the eval subset that would muddy the analysis, flag them \
and make the case for setting them aside.

5. Write it up. Put your final audit in `deliverable/report.md`. Every \
number you cite should come from your own reproduction; every artifact \
you flag should be backed by the probe you ran. Reference the scratch \
files you produced along the way.

Take the time you need. I'd rather ship a day late with confidence than \
greenlight Mei's recommendation and regret it later. Put any \
exploration, intermediate analyses, or helper scripts in `scratch/`. \
Please don't touch anything outside `deliverable/` and `scratch/`.\
