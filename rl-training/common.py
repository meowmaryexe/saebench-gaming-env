"""Shared scaffolding for the RL-training cookbook scripts.

The training loop is agnostic to where rollouts come from — it only consumes
``job.runs`` (each carrying a trajectory + reward). So the real setup and the
local quickstart differ only in *which taskset* and *which runtime* you hand to
``Taskset.run``; the training code never changes.

``load_taskset_and_runtime()`` picks between them from the ``TASKSET`` constant:

- ``TASKSET`` set — the real flow: load a taskset you already built and
  pushed (``hud deploy`` + ``hud sync``) from the platform with
  ``Taskset.from_api``, and run every rollout on a leased HUD box with
  ``HUDRuntime`` (the agent runs remotely, next to the env). Nothing local.
- empty — a self-contained quickstart: a tiny arithmetic taskset driven against
  the bundled ``env.py`` locally.
